/**
 * Centralized i18n overrides for the bundled Freemius SDK.
 *
 * The SDK ships English copy with notice titles like "Yee-haw!" and
 * "Hmm..." that don't fit Editoria11y's plain, professional voice. It
 * also uses generic "Pro / plan / premium" terminology where we want
 * "Editoria11y CSA" specifically. We intercept those strings via the
 * SDK's documented `fs_override_i18n()` API so we don't fork vendor/.
 *
 * Each override is keyed by the SDK's internal string key (the third
 * arg to `*_text_x_inline` / second arg to `*_text_inline`) — NOT by
 * the English text. The SDK looks up `$fs_text_overrides[$slug][$key]`
 * before falling back to its inline default, so our replacements take
 * effect regardless of the active locale.
 *
 * The `entries()` method is the source of truth: each entry pins the
 * `original` English we reviewed against, the `replacement` we chose,
 * and a `note` explaining the surrounding pairing. The audit script at
 * `scripts/audit-freemius-strings.php` reads `entries()` and diffs the
 * `original` field against the live SDK source so a Freemius bump
 * surfaces drift before it ships to users.
